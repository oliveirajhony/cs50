# Weak 0 - Scratch

In the first week, I used Scratch to understand programming concepts like variables, conditional statements, and loops to develop the computational thinking I needed for the next few weeks. 

I had the opportunity to create a game using Scratch, which was the challenge for the first week of the course. My game was called Crazyball and it consisted of clicking on balls that randomly appeared on the screen. It was an amazing experience because, in addition to learning how to use Scratch, I was able to exercise my creativity and logic to develop the game.

In Crazyball, the player had three difficulty levels to choose from: easy, medium, and hard. As the difficulty increased, the speed of the balls also increased and they appeared and disappeared more quickly in different parts of the screen. At the end of each level, the player's score was shown, which could be one, two, or three stars depending on how many balls they were able to catch.

Creating the game was a lot of fun and seeing the final result was very rewarding. The feeling of being able to put into practice the ideas that came to mind was very gratifying. In addition, the process of testing and making adjustments to make the game more challenging and fun was very interesting and added a lot to the learning experience.
